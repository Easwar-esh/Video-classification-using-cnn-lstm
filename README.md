# Video-classification-using-cnn-lstm
Video classification involves analyzing and categorizing video content based on its visual and auditory features. This is a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of video data. CNN-LSTM models are designed to capture both spatial and temporal features in video data, making them a powerful tool for video classification tasks.

By working on video classification projects, you can gain valuable experience in applying deep learning techniques to real-world problems and develop skills in data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
This repository contains the code of CNN-LSTM model to classify the video.The dataset  UCF101 is taken.
